Project 1

Static HTML website.
Super simple HTML, CSS and Javascript website that I created when first learning to code with SheCodes.io
The aim of the project was to incorporate all the major components of the bootcamp into a simple page.
I chose to do it about photographers because it's one of my hobbies and a topic I thoroughly enjoy.
